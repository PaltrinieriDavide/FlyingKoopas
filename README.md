## Overview
**Flying Koopas** is a game developed as a project for the OOP exam at UniMoRe computer engineering.

The project was born from the collaboration of Davide Paltrinieri and Riccardo Masetti.

## How to use
The game is inspired by **BBTAN** (by 111%) but modified using the features of a **Super Mario Bros** game.

The aim of the game is to destroy all items on the screen using koopas which are dropped by destroying question marks.

It's possible to **direct** the koopas by holding down the mouse on the screen, and to decide the **launch power** by moving away from the koopas' spawn point. 
The launch will be performed once the mouse is released.

Once all the items have been destroyed, it will be possible to start a new game.
